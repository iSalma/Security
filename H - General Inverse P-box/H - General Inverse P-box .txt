Given a permutation box, output its inverse permutation box(The permutation box that when given the output of the original permutation box as an input, produces as its output the input to the original permutation box.) If the permutation box is non reversible, output a single line IMPOSSIBLE.

The input and output sizes of the permutation box are NOT necessarily equal. Note Multiple solutions might exist, you should output the one that is lexicographically smaller. See Notes for extra details.
Input

The first line consists of 2 numbers which, respectively, represent the size of the input of the P-box (in) and the size of the output of the P-box (out). 1?=?in,?out?=?128. The second line contains out numbers that represent the P-box. Each number is between 1 and in.
Output

Output 1 line that contains in numbers which represent the inverse P-box.
